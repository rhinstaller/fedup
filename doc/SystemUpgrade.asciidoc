Here are some guidelines for implementing offline OS *upgrades* using systemd
and dracut.

This is similar to systemd's {SystemUpdates} concept, but it's
designed for doing _major-version_ system upgrades with the system _completely
offline_, with the upgrade running from inside an initrd or other RAM-based
filesystem image.

The process described here should work for any Linux distribution that uses
systemd. Distro-specific details like the method for finding and downloading
necessary packages are left to the distributions.

.Upgrade vs. Update
NOTE: This document uses "up**grade**" when talking about _major-version
system upgrades_ but "up**date**" when talking about a _minor or partial
system update_.

Overview
--------

=== Download ===
The upgrade tool examines the system and determines what data (packages, boot
images, whatever) is needed to upgrade to the new version. (This part is very
much distribution-specific, so details are left to the implementor.)

You'll also need a kernel and initramfs for the upgrade. Whether these are
downloaded or created locally is up to the implementation.

The initramfs should contain a file named `etc/system-upgrade-release`, which
follows the format of {os-release}.


=== Preparation ===
When the user decides to start the upgrade, the tool does the following steps
*in order*.

. copy boot images into place (typically in `/boot`)
. add a bootloader entry for the upgrade boot images
. create directories and flag files:
  * create an empty directory, `/system-upgrade-root`
  * create `/system-upgrade`, a symlink to the directory containing
    downloaded upgrade data
  * create `/system-upgrade/vmlinuz`, a symlink to the new kernel
  * create `/system-upgrade/initrd.img`, a symlink to the new initramfs
  * create a temporary directory (`INITRD_TMPDIR`)
. run executables in `/usr/lib/system-upgrade/preboot`
  * the first argument is `INITRD_TMPDIR`
  * the environment will contain:
  ** `UPGRADE_KERNEL_VERSION`: new kernel version (eg "3.11.7-200.fc19.x86_64")
  ** `UPGRADE_INITRD_VERSION`: `VERSION_ID` from `system-upgrade-release`
  * if any of these return a non-zero exit code, the upgrade should halt
. inject addon files into the initrd
  * all files under `INITRD_TMPDIR` are copied into the initrd
. _optional_: make the new bootloader entry the default and reboot the system

=== Upgrade startup (initrd to root mount) ===
. The system is booted as usual
. The kernel and initrd find the root device as usual
. _Before mounting the root device_, the initrd may run scripts for
  filesystem migration (or other tasks that require offline disks)
. The root device is mounted
. The initrd makes a copy of `$NEWROOT/system-upgrade` at `/run/system-upgrade`
. Control transfers to the old system

=== Upgrade startup (old system mounts other disks) ===
. `system-upgrade-generator` changes the default target to
  `system-upgrade.target` if the following conditions are met:
  * `/system-upgrade` is a symbolic link to a directory
  * `/system-upgrade-root` is a directory
  * `/run/system-upgrade` exists (i.e. was created by special upgrade initrd)
. Everything up to `sysinit.target` happens normally (mounting disks, &c)
. The upgrade runtime image is copied into a tmpfs at `/system-upgrade-root`
. (distro-dependent) sanity checks on the upgrade data, e.g. "files listed in
  `/system-upgrade/package.list` must exist".
  * If any of these checks fail, the upgrade should abort.
. After `system-upgrade.target`, systemd pivots into `/system-upgrade-root`
  and puts the old system root at `/sysroot`

=== Upgrade ===
The upgrade image is responsible for upgrading the system in whatever
system-specific manner is appropriate. The environment will be as follows:

* The system is mounted at `/sysroot`
* Upgrade data (packages etc.) can be found in `/sysroot/system-upgrade`
  ** Note that the filesystem root has changed, so `/system-upgrade` should
     be a relative symlink - or the upgrade tool should resolve the link
     itself
* The upgrade tool should remove the `/system-upgrade` link and
  `/system-upgrade-root` directory if it finishes successfully.

HERE IS MORE DETAILS ABOUT SOME THINGS OK.

=== preboot scripts ===
After adding the boot entry, but _before_ reboot, the upgrade tool should run
each executable file in the preboot dir (`/usr/lib/system-upgrade/preboot`).

If any of these commands returns a non-zero status, the output from the
command should be shown to the user and the system should *not* proceed with
the upgrade. The tool should remove the boot entry and other flag files to
ensure the upgrade does not proceed.

Preboot scripts may also do whatever system modifications might be necessary
to get the new system to boot - e.g. migrating old boot arguments, modifying
configuration files, grabbing config files or kernel modules that might be
needed in the initrd, etc.

After the scripts run, any files that have been placed in `INITRD_TMPDIR` will
be copied into the initramfs.

==== preboot script environment ====

The scripts will be executed with `INITRD_TMPDIR` as the first argument.

The environment will contain (at least) these items:

`UPGRADE_KERNEL_VERSION`::
  The version string for `/system-upgrade/vmlinuz` (ex: 3.11.6-300.fc20.x86_64)
`UPGRADE_INITRD_VERSION`::
  The `VERSION_ID` for `/system-upgrade/initrd.img` (ex: 0.8.0)

All other data needed for the upgrade will be available in `/system-upgrade`.

FAQs
----

Why not just use SystemUpdates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Despite what the page says, {SystemUpdates} is not fully offline; various
parts of the system are in use when the update runs (udev and systemd are
running, also maybe plymouth, various storage daemons, etc.).

For most small, incremental updates this isn't a problem, but some changes are
large enough that attempting to apply them as updates to a (partially) running
system is either dangerous, unpredictable, or just plain impossible.

For example, moving `/bin`, `/sbin`, and `/lib` to `/usr` while your system is
running will probably cause some very odd, hard-to-diagnose problems. And
migrating a system from `ext3` to `ext4` just isn't possible if the disk is
already in use.

Why the special initrd (`upgrade.img`)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As mentioned above, we definitely want to run upgrades from a seprate
filesystem than your normal root, so your system is offline during the
upgrade.

Also, it's a good idea to run the upgrade using the new system's kernel,
drivers, tools, SELinux policy, etc. It saves trouble fixing up problems after
the upgrade, and in some cases it's necessary to make the upgrade work.

For example: when Fedora switched to using XZ-compressed RPM payloads, there
would be no way for the older version of `rpm` to unpack the newer RPMs. You
need the newer (xz-capable) `rpm` to install the new (xz-compressed) RPMs.

Why the double-switch-root? Why not let `upgrade.img` mount all the disks?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is how `anaconda` used to try to set up the upgrade, but it turns out to
be unreliable. First, there's quite a few ways to set up mounts:

* `/etc/fstab`
* systemd `.mount` units
** could be generated dynamically from systemd generators!
* manual mounting from init scripts and/or systemd services

Even if we did force all mounts into `/etc/fstab` and/or static `.mount`
units, we'd still have to make sure the initrd could find all the
_configuration files_ that might be needed - `crypttab`, `lvm.conf`,
`mdadm.conf`, etc. And what if something changes between versions? What if the
new version wants to use `/etc/lvm/lvm3.conf`?

On the other hand, your existing system knows how to do all of this already.
It does it just fine every time your system boots, right?

In short: the best way to make sure your system gets set up normally is to
_let your system set itself up normally_.

Which means the simplest, most reliable solution is to (roughly) `chroot()`
into your old system, tell it to set up its disks, then exit the chroot and
start the upgrade. It might seem complicated, but in practice the
alternative is worse.

Why do you need to use `/system-upgrade-root` for the upgrade root?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In my testing, `pivot_root` and/or `switch_root` didn't work unless the new
root was a subdirectory of `/`.

Future topics
-------------

* Suggested behavior on failures?
** Reboot vs. emergency shell vs. ...
* Define location/use of upgrade state file?
** We need a way to report failure to user if the upgrade reboots...
** Hang with timeout, write message to state file...
* Snapshot checkpoint?
* Suggested time for cleanup?
