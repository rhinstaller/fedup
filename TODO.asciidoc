TODO
====

_(ordered by priority, roughly)_

Safety checks::
  * Check to make sure packages in `package.list` all exist
  * If /etc/yum/vars/releasever exists, complain to user (#908017)

Migration::
  * Add a _fedup-before-upgrade_ scriptlet hook
  ** Not technically a dracut hook, since it'll be run by fedup
  ** Example uses:
  *** https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=881624[Bug #881624]:
      Migrate `KEYTABLE=...` to `KEYMAP=...`
  *** https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=881670[Bug #881670]:
      Add x-systemd.device-timeout=0 for mounts that need it

Disk space handling::
  * Pad RPM diskspace check to require more disk
  * Add `--packagedir` and `--cachedir` flags

Crash handling::
  * Log state to a file
  * Display error message, wait for keypress, then reboot:
  ** "The upgrade failed. Your system has not been harmed. Press <Enter> to
      restart your system."
  ** Allow reboot-on-failure (e.g. for remote systems)

Downloading::
  * Do async/multithreaded downloads
  ** See https://github.com/wgwoods/fedup/pull/8
  *** Need to fix the console output, though...
  * Use yum's console output for downloads (see bug #981819)
  ** Or at least show download speed / ETA

Logging::
  * Log the disk layout (lvs, pvs, blkid, fstab, mounts) in debug log

Commandline behavior::
  * Write sys.argv into config file
  ** use `fedup --continue` to repeat last run
  ** use `fedup --abort` to delete stored args and remove bootloader config
  * Don't mess with bootloader unless specifically requested
  * At end of upgrade: ``Run 'fedup --reboot' to begin upgrade''
  ** and/or `fedup --start`

distro-sync mode::
  * Add `--distro-sync` flag (or similar)
  * Download packages from new repos, even if they're older
  ** How does yum implement this?
  * Need to pass along a flag (in upgrade.conf?) to the upgrade tool

update-groups mode::
  * Add `--update-groups` flag (or similar)
  * Reinstall each group that yum lists as installed (see yum.igroups)
  ** Extra argument for mandatory vs. default

ISO/Device/"Offline" upgrades::
  * Handle ISO-on-USB-stick case
  * Handle mount chains deeper than ISO-on-USB

Upstreaming::
  * systemd: get system-upgrade.target, system-upgrade-generator upstream
  ** Parallel with http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/SystemUpdates/

Updates::
  * Scheme for associating updates images with upgrade.img vintages

GUI::
  * Wire up the UI bits
  * Wire up progress callbacks
  ** yum in a subprocess
  *** use `multiprocessing.Queue` to send back progress data?

Docs::
  * man pages for services
  * man pages for targets
  * document boot args

SELinux::
  * Find a way to run upgrade with SELinux enforcing
  . Start with new policy while in initramfs
  . Enforce the old policy after switching to old system
  . Use the new policy for writing files during upgrade
